# Fashion_Retail_Sales_Analysis
This project analyses a fashion retail sales dataset extracted from Kaggle. The objective of this project is to explore customer purchases patterns, common and interesting behaviours between them and product trends to generate actionable insights that may help the sales and marketing strategy.

This is my first project ever as a Computer Engineering student, as part of my portfolio to become a Data Analyst, proving data cleaning skills, visualization, explained analysis and basic tecnics of data modelling.
